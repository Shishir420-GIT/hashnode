In our earlier post [here](https://shishirsrivastav.hashnode.dev/function-calling-vs-agentic-ai), we understood the basic difference.

* Function Calling is like handing a tool to the AI.
    
* Agentic AI is like assigning a goal to AI (an intelligent assistant).
    

But when you are designing a system or designing a product, is it that simple? Let‚Äôs go a bit deeper into it.

## **Why choose Function Calling?**

1. The task is deterministic, that is 1 input is 1 expected output
    
2. You want the AI to trigger some specific backend services only
    
3. You need control over what the AI can or cannot do (at least to some extent, possible in Agentic as well).
    
4. You want the explanation to be minimal, and a function gets the work done.
    

### **Example scenarios:**

| **Scenario** | **Function. Call Use** |
| --- | --- |
| Check real-time flight status | `get_flight_details(flight_number)` |
| Close my ticket | `close_ticket_in_tool(ticket_number)` |
| Fetch product details | `get_product_info(productID)` |
| Get the current weather report | `fetch_weather_status(city, country)` |

### **Description for Agentic AI:**

A minimal description as well might just do it, but if you want to be accurate, make sure it covers just enough information to avoid ambiguity between different functions.

Each function needs:

* A name
    
* A description
    
* The parameter schema
    

This is so the AI knows which function to use and how, as shown in an example below:

```json
{
	"name": "get_weather",
	"description": "fetches the current weather for a given city and country",
	"parameters": {
	  "type": "object",
	  "properties": {
	    "city": {
	      "type": "string",
	      "description": "The name of the city"
	    }
	  },
	  "required": ["city"]
	}
}
```

## Why choose Agentic AI?

* The task you are trying to accomplish requires reasoning + memory.
    
* You expect multi-step decisions.
    
* You want the AI to adapt if something fails.
    
* You need coordination between tools. APIs and sub-agents.
    

### **Example scenario:**

| **Scenario** | **Agentic AI Use fit?** |
| --- | --- |
| Researching the best laptop under 50,000, comparing 3 options, and emailing a summary. | AI uses reasoning to define tasks and accomplish them in order, and then proceeds to complete the task after receiving the go-ahead command. |
| Diagnosing a server failure: logs, metrics, root cause, fix suggestion |  |
| Drafting a legal agreement based on company policy, laws, and client needs. |  |
| Scraping some webpages when trying to find information that is not available in the database. |  |

### **Description for Agentic AI:**

Since we are building a system where the agents plan their own actions, a description becomes much more important than function calling. The description helps define the behaviour, since this is a semi-autonomous system, it needs that guidance to begin with.

Agentic systems require:

* Agent roles (e.g., ‚ÄúYou are the best reader‚Äù).
    
* Tools are available to each agent.
    
* Goals/tasks are described clearly.
    
* Optional but improves quality- Feedback loops, retries, parallelism, priority queues.
    

## Let‚Äôs compare a Real-Life scenario:

Imagine you‚Äôre building an AI-powered IT Assistant for a company.

**First, let‚Äôs use function calling:**

You define:

* `get_cpu_usage(server_id)`
    
* `restart_service(server_id, service_name)`
    
* `get_disk_space(server_id)`
    

User sends prompt: ‚ÄúCheck CPU usage on server-123‚Äú.

* The model will call `get_cpu_usage(‚Äúserver-123‚Äú)`.
    

It‚Äôs precise, fast, and predictable.

**Now, let‚Äôs see the scenario with Agentic AI:**

You define:

* A diagnostics agent that can analyse logs, metrics, and propose actions.
    
* Tools like `get_logs`, `run_command`, `restart_service`.
    

User sends prompt: ‚ÄúInvestigate why server-123 is running slow‚Äú.

The agent now may:

* Fetch the CPU and memory stats.
    
* Check recent logs.
    
* Notice a service crash.
    
* Propose a fix or restart the service.
    
* Summarise all the findings.
    

Although it is flexible, autonomous, and context-aware, it requires more setup.

## Summary Table: Design-Level Comparison:

| **Feature** | **Function Calling** | **Agentic AI** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use Case Type | Simple tasks | Complex workflows |
| Requires Function Description | Yes (breif schema + params) | Yes (but often more detailed for reasoning) |
| Requires Agent/Task Description | NO | Yes (roles, tools, objectives) |
| Handles Failure/Recovery | NO | Yes |
| Tool Use Flexibility | Fixed (One function per request) | Dynamic (chooses tools based on need) |
| Output Interpretation | User-defined logic influences the response | The agent decides when the task is complete |
| Setup Time | Minimal | Moderate to high |
| Real-World Analogy | Calling a specific technician | Hiring a project manager |

## Final thoughts: When to use What?

| **Use case** | **Optimal Choice** |
| --- | --- |
| You need tight control and fast responses | Function Calling |
| You want goal-based behaviour with multiple steps | Agentic AI |
| You‚Äôre building a microservice that AI will query | Function Calling |
| You‚Äôre automating processes like IT, HR or sales | Agentic AI |

## **TL;DR**

* Function Calling is like handing AI a calculator, it solves something specific when asked.
    
* Agentic AI is like hiring a virtual assistant; it thinks, decides, and acts.
    

Both are powerful, and together, they are the future of intelligent applications.
